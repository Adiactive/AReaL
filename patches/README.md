# Third-party patches

Patches applied to pinned third-party sources during the NPU image build
(`Dockerfile.a2`, `Dockerfile.a3`). Each patch is applied with `git apply` at an
explicit point in the target's installation, so a patch that no longer applies fails the
build instead of silently dropping the fix. The vLLM patches run after their editable
installs; the Megatron-Bridge patch runs immediately after its pinned checkout.

The vLLM patches are applied in table order and target vLLM 0.26. The content transport
and exact-token assertion stay separate because their lifetimes differ.

The vllm-ascend pin includes
[#15981](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/15981), which repairs cached
upstream MoE factory bindings in already imported model modules. The local Qwen3-MoE
import-order workaround is no longer needed. This is separate from the Megatron-Bridge
Qwen3-ASR registration guard below, which is still required.

The two vLLM patches carry AReaL's exact-token generation contract, so that a multimodal
rollout computes behavior logprobs from the same token sequence it trains on. See issue
#1612 for the problem statement and the staged plan.

- **vllm#51478** — merged upstream on 2026-08-11, after the `v0.23.0` and `v0.26.0`
  tags. Adds `content_parts` to `/inference/v1/generate` so one request carries
  caller-supplied token ids together with raw media. Python frontend only: AReaL
  launches vLLM through `areal.engine.vllm_ext.areal_vllm_server`, which patches Python
  vLLM's `build_app`.
- **exact-token-validation** — AReaL-local, no upstream equivalent. vLLM expands
  multimodal placeholders itself, so the caller sends the collapsed prompt in
  `token_ids` and its locally expanded prompt in `expected_token_ids`; the server
  refuses to generate unless its expansion matches. Neither vLLM patch may reference
  AReaL's pause event — weight-update policy stays in AReaL source.

## Megatron-Bridge compatibility fixes

**Megatron-Bridge#4784** fixes the autograd collective used when
`vision_dp_when_cp=True`. Its backward pass must sum gradients from every CP rank before
slicing the local image range. It also keeps empty-image and frozen-vision ranks in the
collective and creates empty outputs in the model parameter dtype. Without the complete
fix, training can silently compute incomplete vision gradients or hang when ranks do not
participate symmetrically.

The vision portion contains the two production-source changes from upstream commit
`1d65d5756f2bf9f7f8734467a72272901bfcb4e3`. Those hunks apply directly to the pinned
Megatron-Bridge `v0.5.1` revision and do not require Megatron-Core 0.19. Remove the
vision portion when the Bridge pin contains that commit.

The same patch also carries the current upstream Qwen3-ASR registration guard.
Transformers 5.14 includes a native `qwen3_asr` config, so Bridge must skip all three
vendored Auto-class registrations when that native mapping exists. Without the guard,
importing `megatron.bridge` fails before actor model construction.

## Patching dirties the tree, which changes `vllm.__version__`

vLLM derives its version with setuptools-scm, which appends a dev suffix when the
worktree is dirty. vllm-ascend uses the detected version for compatibility routing, so
each image installs the clean checkout before applying its versioned patches.

Patching *after* `pip install -e .` avoids this: setuptools-scm records the version from
the still-clean tree, and `vllm/_version.py` is generated once at install time rather
than recomputed at import, so the tree going dirty afterwards no longer matters. This
ordering is load-bearing — do not move a `git apply` above its install.

It relies on the install being editable. Without `-e`, pip would copy the sources at
install time and the patch would land on a copy nothing imports, silently dropping the
fix. Both installs must therefore stay `-e`.

The vLLM patch group is followed by an assertion that the recorded version still equals
the tag, so a regression here fails the build rather than the first rollout of a
training run. It reads `vllm/_version.py` directly rather than importing vLLM, which at
that point in the build has neither torch nor an NPU available. Adding a patch means
adding its `git apply` above that assertion, never below it.

## Bumping vLLM

The patch contents follow the versions in `VLLM_TAG` / `VLLM_ASCEND_BRANCH`. Keep the
vLLM patch filenames stable across upgrades; update their contents, header provenance,
and the target versions in the table above. If a fix has landed, delete the patch and
its `COPY` / `git apply` lines from both Dockerfiles.
